title: On What Makes a Conversation Real

<hr />

In response to a recent post on [Substack](https://kevinozkal.substack.com/i/187861158/conversations-dont-happen-online) about whether conversations truly happen online.

I agree with the core point: it is absolutely possible to engage one
person — or a few people — at a personal level and have an actual
conversation. Those moments still exist. They matter. They are rare enough
now that we feel them when they happen.

At the same time, I’m not sure technology has eliminated conversation so
much as moved parts of it. Some of it has become asynchronous. Some of it
has become fragmented. What feels missing to me isn’t just proximity —
it’s a space to call our own. A place where thought isn’t immediately
compressed into reaction.

Sometimes, too, the most honest thing we can do is stop talking. We might
need less commentary and more listening. Less response and more
observation. Not everything requires our voice. Some things require our
attention.

In the post, there was a line about how the American system was created to
allow for flex and growth — for progress. That resonated deeply with me.
As a child, that was my understanding of America: imperfect, but
structured in a way that allowed for correction.

That belief feels harder to hold today. The environment we live in now
rewards immediacy, outrage, and performance more than reflection. We are
surrounded by things constantly demanding our attention, and not all of
them deserve it. Even the good things, taken in excess, can distort us.
Too much noise eventually becomes indistinguishable from none at all.

I believe in personal responsibility. But responsibility only makes sense
if we take the time to examine it — otherwise we risk defending positions
we haven’t really thought through. Reflection without responsibility
becomes drift. The “right thing” only makes sense if we have space to
consider what that actually is.

It often feels like we’ve lost shared clarity about what the right thing
even means.

I do believe there are shared principles capable of anchoring a society —
perhaps even a single enduring value. Integrity. Loyalty. Critical
thinking. The discipline of sitting still long enough to examine our own
assumptions.

There is power in stillness. There is power in doing nothing for a moment.
There is power in thinking before speaking.

I’m also aware that the nature of conversation may continue to change.
Artificial intelligence, large language models, and algorithmic feeds are
reshaping how ideas move and how people encounter one another. It’s
possible that the next form of conversation won’t look like the ones we’re
nostalgic for.

But whatever the medium becomes, I suspect the core requirements won’t
change: presence, integrity, curiosity, and the willingness to listen
without immediately defending.

Thank you for writing the piece. It made me slow down and consider what I
actually mean when I say “conversation.”

I shared this reflection directly in response to the original post as
well.
