# Markdown demo

This note is a quick demo of what the renderer supports — nothing fancy, just the usual markdown bits.

## Inline and blocks

The renderer supports the usual stuff: *emphasis*, **bold**, `inline code`, and [links](https://example.com). Headings, lists, and code blocks work too:

- Bullet list
- Another item

- [x] Task lists (checked)
- [ ] And unchecked

A little code with syntax highlighting:

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}.`;
}
```

That’s the idea — write in markdown, get clean HTML and readable code blocks.
