    <p><em>February 2026</em></p>

    <p>At first, I thought building a prediction model was the strategy.</p>

    <p>
      Over time, it became clear that the model wasn’t the main thing. It was an
      entry point. What it surfaced was a broader architectural question: where
      should intelligence actually live inside an organization?
    </p>

    <p>
      That shift has changed how I think about AI integration. It feels less
      like adding models and more like layering intelligence on top of systems
      that already exist.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s hard not to think about the same pattern in humans — layers of
      cognition stacked on top of older systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the base of that architecture is structured data — the operational
      records that reflect what has actually happened. When we use that data to
      generate predictions — cost ranges, timelines, anomaly detection — we’re
      working from deterministic history. This layer doesn’t need semantic
      interpretation. It needs clean schemas, well-defined logic, and
      disciplined modeling. It produces something close to institutional truth.
    </p>

    <p>But structured data alone isn’t enough.</p>

    <p>
      There’s a difference between the system specification and the
      institutional memory that surrounds it. The specification defines the
      “what” and the “how” — schemas, APIs, business logic, guarantees. It
      should be precise and deterministic.
      <strong>That’s where truth is enforced.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      The knowledge layer captures the “why” and the “when.” Design tradeoffs.
      Failure modes. Situations where outputs shouldn’t be trusted blindly. This
      layer is narrative and meaning-heavy. It’s where semantic search makes
      sense. Separating the rules of the system from the history of its
      implementation moves tribal knowledge into infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Above those layers sits the orchestration layer — where LLMs and agents
      live.
    </p>

    <p>Here, in my view, the boundary matters.</p>

    <p>
      LLMs can reason and translate. They can summarize metrics, interpret
      natural language, draft explanations. But they don’t decide. Structured
      systems decide. Humans remain accountable.
    </p>

    <p>That hierarchy isn’t dramatic — it’s structural.</p>

    <p>
      If that boundary erodes, the system becomes unstable. If it holds, LLMs
      remain useful interfaces rather than quiet authorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      The intelligence of the system shows up over time through <i>feedback</i>.
      A prediction is made. An outcome is observed. When it’s wrong, we record
      why. <i>Structured</i> feedback improves models. <i>Textual</i> feedback
      updates context. <i>Patterns</i> that repeat eventually move from
      narrative into code.
    </p>

    <p>
      That loop — observation to explanation to structural update — is what
      gradually turns a tool into a learning system.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m still thinking through this. But it feels less like “adding AI” and
      more like deciding where intelligence belongs — and making sure the
      boundaries are clear before the tools get more capable.
